# Election_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to tally the votes from an election, determine the vote counts and percentages for each candidate, and, finally, determine who the winning candidate of the election. 

The votes are stored in the election_results.csv file, located in the Resources folder. The results of the analysis are outputted to the election_analysis.txt file, located in the analysis folder.

The output of the analysis is the following:
